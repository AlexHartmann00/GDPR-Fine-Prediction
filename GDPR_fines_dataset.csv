In January, the municipality of Rygge was annexed to the municipality of Moss. For this reason, several IT systems from both municipalities were combined. Due to inadequate security measures, a data breach occurred in a productive system used in the municipality's health service. This system processed personal and health data and affected people who live in the municipality and use the health center. The system is used for services related to immunization programs in the municipality, as well as for other health checks and follow-ups of pregnant women. About 2000 people were potentially affected by the breach. Due to the data breach, errors had occurred in vaccine registration. As a result, the data subjects were at risk of receiving the wrong vaccines. There was also a potential for their immunization data to be misfiled in the national immunization registry. Furthermore, errors occurred in follow-ups for pregnant women, including information on the week of pregnancy or the mother's drug use. Also, patient information was provided to health workers in a health service ward without being required and without access being documented."

As part of an investigation, the DPA conducted an audit of the processing of personal data by the council or on its behalf using video surveillance systems, automatic license plate recognition, body-worn cameras and other technologies that can be used to monitor individuals. In doing so, it found that the Council had violated a number of data protection laws in its use of the technologies. However, the fine was issued due to GDPR violations. The DPA found that the Council violated Art. 13 GDPR in relation to the processing of data by traffic cameras. The Council had failed to provide information on the identity of the data controller, the contact details of the data protection officer, the purposes of the processing and the bodies from which further information required under Art. 13 GDPR may be obtained. In addition, the Council failed to provide this information in an easily accessible manner such as on signs near the cameras. Further, the DPA concluded that the Council failed to post a video surveillance policy in an clear and plain language as well as in an easily accessible area of the Council's website. The DPA thus found an infringement of Art. 12 GDPR. Lastly, the Council has denied requests for access to personal data processed by surveillance cameras used in traffic management. For this reason, the DPA found that the Council violated Art. 15 GDPR."

Sensors in the measurement boxes detected the wifi signals from the cell phones of passers-by and registered them with a code. Based on the registered codes, it was possible to calculate how busy the city center was. However, this also made it possible to track which measurement box a particular cell phone passed by, making it possible to track the movement of passers-by. The municipality states that it was never its intention to track passers-by. However, the DPA finds that the wifi tracking (even if it was unintentional) constitutes a serious breach of the GDPR.

The supervisory authority is of the opinion that biometric data of students was processed which is why Art. 9 GDPR is applicable. Additionally, the authority argued that consent can not be applied since students and their guardians cannot freely decide if they/their children want to be monitored for attendance purposes. When examining if the school board can rely on any of the exemptions listed in Art. 9 (2), the supervisory authority found that this was not the case. The supervisory authority also found that there was a case of a processing activity with high risks since new technology was used to process sensitive personal data concerning children who are in a dependency position to the high school board and due to camera surveillance being used in the students everyday environment.

The computer hard drive in question was not encrypted and the program in question, which contained confidential and sensitive personal data, was not equipped with security measures. In reviewing the case, the DPO found that Favrskov Municipality had not ensured the encryption of the hard drives of the municipality's laptops for a long period of time prior to August 12, 2020, resulting in an inadequate level of security.

A student had filed a complaint with the DPA about possible GDPR violations related to the use of a monitoring system during written exams. In the context of the emergency situation triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, the university had equipped itself with the remote monitoring software Respondus provided by the American company Respondus Inc. to ensure the normal running of the exams, since it was not possible to take the exams live and in person as usual. The software was able to monitor the behavior of the students through video recordings and snapshots taken at random intervals. In addition, the exam was audio-visually recorded and a photograph was taken of each examinee at the beginning of the exam. At the end of the exam, the system processed the video, inserted warning signals regarding possible indications of incorrect behavior, and, among other things, assigned a so-called 'review priority' so that the examiner could subsequently assess whether an unauthorized act had been committed during the exam. In its investigation the DPA found that students were not properly informed of the processing of their personal data involved in the use of Respondus. For instance they were not informed that they would be audiovisually recorded and that the images would subsequently be processed. In addition, students were not provided with information regarding specific retention periods for personal data. Nor had they received sufficient information about the fact that their personal data would be transferred to the United States  instead, they were only informed in general terms that personal data would be processed both within and outside the territory of the European Union. Furthermore, the DPA found that the little information the students had received was presented in a fragmented and disorganized manner in various documents. The DPA considered this to be a violation of the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency. The DPA also found that the university had processed the personal data without a valid legal basis. Thus, consent to the processing of personal data was a prerequisite to participate in the exams in the first place. As an alternative to online exams, the option of an in-person exam was proposed. However, in the light of the pandemic, this also meant an increased health risk. Students were also concerned that refusing to take the online exams would negatively impact their grades. Consequently, the DPA concluded that the students' consent could not be considered voluntary. Further, the DPA found that the university retained the data for 12 months, although this would not have been necessary for the purpose of ensuring that the exams were properly carried out. Eventually, the DPA found violations related to the transfer of data to Respondus. The processing agreement between the University and Respondus was based on the data protection agreement between the EU and the USA, known as the Privacy Shield, although it had been declared invalid by the Schrems II ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). For this reason, the DPA found that the university transferred personal data to a third country, even though this transfer was not in compliance with the conditions set forth in Chapter V of the GDPR."

This is the highest fine ever imposed by the Dutch DPA As part of its investigation, the DPA found a number of violations of the GDPR. The Tax and Customs Administration had kept a list for several years on which it recorded indications of fraud. The list contained information on over 270,000 individuals, including minors. The administration had processed personal data such as health, citizenship, and criminal personal data as part of the list maintenance. The DPA initially found that the administration did not have a valid legal basis for processing the data contained in the list. For this reason, the data were processed unlawfully. Further, the DPA found that the information in the list was often incorrect, so that a large number of individuals were falsely registered as possible fraudsters. In addition, the investigation revealed that the maintenance of the list led to discrimination against some individuals, as the risk of fraud was determined on the basis of the nationality and appearance of the data subjects, among other factors. For example, donations to mosques were considered a risk factor for fraud. Furthermore, the DPA found that the administration violated its obligation under the GDPR to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures that ensure adequate protection of the personal data it collects. Indeed, the administration had inadequately secured the personal data. The DPA also found that the administration had violated the principle of storage limitation by storing the data for a longer time contrary to the retention period established for the personal data in the list. Furthermore, the DPA found that the processing of the data in the list had not been necessary for the administration to properly perform its tasks. The processing was therefore disproportionate. Also, the administration had not sufficiently defined the purposes underlying the processing and thus violated the principle of purpose limitation. The fine is composed as follows: EUR 1 million for a breach of Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR and Art. 6 (1) GDPR; EUR 750,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) b) GDPR; EUR 750,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) d) GDPR; EUR 250,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) e) GDPR; EUR 500,000 for a breach of Art. 32 (1) GDPR EUR 450,000 for a breach of Art. 35 (2) GDPR."

The municipality had accidentally published a document in which 10 out of 21 attachments contained personal data of students. The data included information on student names, date of birth, test results, assessments of student behavior and student challenges. This error was not detected by the responsible administrator and went through two more manual quality checks at the documentation center without the error being detected there as well. It was only a journalist who later drew attention to the data breach. During its investigation, the DPA found that the municipality had not taken sufficient technical and organizational measures to protect personal data. Also, the fact that the incident was discovered not by the municipality, but by a third party, indicates inadequate routines in this area."

The city had used the digital education system 'Seesaw' at several schools. The student system processed, among other things, personal data of minor students such as teacher feedback and information about students' private affairs. During its investigation, the DPA found that the purpose of the processing of the children's data had not been sufficiently clearly defined. In this context, the DPA also found a breach of the principle of proportionality and data minimization. In addition, the DPA concluded that the city had not implemented adequate technical and organizational measures regarding the protection of personal data. This would have been necessary given the high risk that the data might be transferred to and processed in the United States. In determining the fine, mitigating consideration was given to the fact that no damage was caused by the data breaches."

Moreover, the DPA found that despite being aware of this data breach, the agency had not reported the breach, contrary to its obligation under Art. 33 GDPR. The DPA concluded that the agency had not taken appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data. Encryption of removable media, for example, is a necessary and required security measure, especially if the removable media contain sensitive information such as personal data."
